The following describes the pipeline for the SNP based enrichment analyses (with relevant
scripts for each part indicated). 

1) Define overlap between PGC SNPs and study SNPs. 
	1a: Define study proxy SNPs: FindProxySNPs.r
	1b: Create overlap SNP list: PGCoverlap.r

2) LD pruning supervised by ASD p-value
	2a: Make genotype files of just overlapped SNPs: PriorityPruner_MakeGenotypes.sh
	2b: Make input table for PriorityPruner: PriorityPrunerInput.relevant
	2c: Run PriorityPruner: RunPriorityPruner.sh

3) Limit PGC data to those that survived pruning (i.e. their direct or proxy overlaps did).
	Annotate SNPs with status as ASD related SNP and meQTL. Count the number of 450k CpG sites within
	meQTL detection window of each SNP. 
		Script: AnnotatePGCresults.r

4) Create bins of MAF and number of 450k CpG sites in proximity, and a joint bin of the two to match
	null set SNPs on. Perform enrichment test across variety of ASD SNP p-values and meQTL p-values. 
		Script: RunSNPEnrichment.r
