The following describes the pipeline for the regulatory feature enrichment analyses
(with relevant scripts for each part indicated). 

There are 2 analyses here:
	Comparison 1: meQTL targets vs. non-meQTL targets
	Comparison 2: meQTL targets of PGC cross disorder SNPs vs meQTL targets of non PGC cross disorder SNPs. 

#Download regulatory element data:
	Script: 
	
#Comparison 1:
	Script: RegulatoryEnrichment_Comparison1.r (see comments in scripts for objects generated in other
		scripts that are used here)
		
#Comparison 2:
	Step 1: Download and format PGC cross-disorder results
		Script: PGC_CrossDisorder.r
	Step 2: Find what SNPs used in each tissue dataset overlap with SNPs of suggestive significance from the 
		PGC cross disorder analysis (or their proxies)
			Script: PGC_CrossDisorder_PGCOverlap.r
	Step 3: Find the CpG sites associated with the SNPs identified in Step 2.
		Script: PGC_CrossDisorder_MappingCpGs.r
	Step 4: Perform Enrichment analyses
		Script: RegulatoryEnrichment_Comparison2.r
